## How It Works

- The game uses a 20x20 grid to render the snake and food.
- Arrow keys or WASD are used for controlling the snake.
- Eating food increases the snake length and score.
- Colliding with the wall or the snake's own body ends the game.
- Speed increases as the snake grows, adding to the challenge.
